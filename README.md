# kebab-case-renamer

The [`kebab-case-renamer.py`](./kebab-case-renamer.py) Python script renames files and directories within a given directory to [kebab-case](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Kebab_case):
1. All lowercase.
2. Space and underscore delimiters replaced with hyphens.

## How to use

1. Run `py kebab-case-renamer.py {directory path}`.
2. Confirm operation with `(y)es` when prompted.

## This is very limited. Any plans to expand to include other styles?

There are no current plans to expand this very much. This was just a quick thing I wrote to get some personal files a bit more organized.
